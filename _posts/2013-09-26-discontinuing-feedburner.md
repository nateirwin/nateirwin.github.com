title: Discontinuing Feedburner
---

I am about to close my Feedburner account, so if you are subscribed via an RSS reader and want to continue receiving updates from this website, you'll need to point your reader at the new feed URL: [http://nateirwin.net/atom.xml](http://nateirwin.net/atom.xml). Sorry about the inconvenience, but I am not convinced that Google will keep Feedburner up and running, and I don't want to be caught with my pants down.
