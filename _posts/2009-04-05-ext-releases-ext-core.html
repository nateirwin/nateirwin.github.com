<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="drop_cap">I</span>f the upcoming 3.0 release of the full ExtJS library wasn't enough to get you excited, yesterday's <a href="http://extjs.com/blog/2009/04/04/ext-core-30-beta-released/" target="_blank">announcement</a> of the release of a new lightweight core library, Ext Core, should be enough to get your pulse up. Ext Core looks to fill the void that exists between a full Ext application (basically a desktop class application built in JavaScript) and more traditional web sites with multiple pages and fairly simple needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The full Ext library is a bit heavy for basic web sites so, up until now developers have had to go with other JavaScript libraries to fill this need (I've generally stuck with jQuery). The release of Ext Core, however, allows developers to utilize their knowledge of and experience with Ext in places where it was otherwise not possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And if you are worried about licensing, worry no more:</p>

<blockquote style="text-align: left;">Ext Core is released under a permissive MIT license - there is no cost to use Ext Core - it's free for everyone.</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">And in traditional Ext style, the code is beautifully-written (at least what I've been able to peruse so far) and <a href="http://extjs.com/products/extcore/manual/" target="_blank">well-documented</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In my opinion, Ext has been overlooked as of late because of the much-publicized <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Ext+licensing" target="_blank">licensing debacle</a>. I still consider it the best JavaScript library out there for writing desktop class web application. I hope that this release will get it some much deserved support from the larger web development community.</p>
