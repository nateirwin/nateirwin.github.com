<span class="drop_cap">L</span>ooking for another reason to buy an iPhone? The app that gets, by far, the most use on my iPhone is <a href="http://reederapp.com/2/">reeder</a>, an RSS reader application that syncs seamlessly with Google Reader.

This is the most elegant app on my phone, and it added a huge feature today: <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> support. Readability basically takes a blog post, extracts the text, and presents it in a highly-readable format. It gets rid of ads, reformats the text, and concatenates "pages" together.

I highly, HIGHLY recommend reeder, and if you have a Mac, you should also check out the <a href="http://madeatgloria.com/brewery/silvio/reeder">public beta</a> of the desktop version.
