<span class="drop_cap">I</span> love music.

I constantly listen to music while I write code, so I'm always looking for new music to listen to. In the past, I've used Amazon, NPR Music, and recommendations from friends to discover new music. I've discovered tons of great music using this approach, but the problem with this is you don't always get to preview the new music (especially not in high quality) before buying it.

This is why I was very excited when I discovered Mog earlier this year. Mog describes itself as the place "where your music listening dreams come true." The service basically allows you to easily discover (important!), search for and stream music via the web or a number of different devices, including iPhone. Sounds great, right? I thought so, so I signed up.

But then a month went by and I realized I had only used Mog a few times, so I decided the $9.99 was not money well spent and canceled my subscription. Why didn't I use the service that really should've/could've been the "holy grail" for music? It is really pretty simple: The Mog web-based music player sucked. It was built using Flash, so mouse clicks were handled sporadically (one of my biggest annoyances with Flash) and it ruined the battery life of my high-end MacBook Pro and caused it to heat up. Unacceptable. Why, you may ask, did I not just use the iPhone app and be happy? I don't know. I guess I've just never been big on streaming music on my iPhone. It probably has something to do with AT&T's shitty service.

So, like I said, I decided to move on -- until yesterday, when I installed Mog's new HTML5-based web app from the Chrome Web Store.

First of all, let me say that I was and still am skeptical about the whole concept of a web application "store". The beauty of the web is that anyone can easily deploy their application to users around the world without going through any type of centralized approval mechanism. That said, I can see why the Chrome Web Store is helpful at this point, as it enables web developers to target the most sophisticated browser and utilize cutting-edge web technologies to build out their apps. I get that, and I'm glad it's here (at least for the moment).

So what makes Mog's new web-based music player so great? It is elegant and very well-designed. Searching for and streaming music should be easy, and with this new player it is. Your queue is persistent, and you can very easily add new music to it, remove music from it, and switch between songs and albums. Secondly, it is fast and it runs perfectly in Chrome. On top of this, it doesn't adversely affect my machine. This is obviously very important.

Needless to say, this is one application from the Chrome Web Store that is definitely worth downloading. And I'll go so far as to say that the new web music player saved my relationship with Mog!
