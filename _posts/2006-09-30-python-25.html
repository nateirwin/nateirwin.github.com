The new version of Python, 2.5, has <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/" target="_blank">been released</a>. It has been over a year and a half since the last release, but from looking at the "<a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/highlights/" target="_blank">What's New</a>" section of <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">python.org</a>, it looks like this release includes some major enhancements. These enhancements include the addition of many new modules to the core Python package. Multiple versions of Python can coexist on a computer, so you don't have to worry about conflicts with the package that comes installed with ArcGIS Desktop.

On a personal note, sorry about the lapse in new substantive posts. Over the last two weeks, I have moved halfway across the country, started a new job, and shifted between three different houses. It looks, though, like things are finally starting to settle down a bit, and I have tons of new projects and discoveries to discuss. More to come soon.
