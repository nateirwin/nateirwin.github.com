<a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=downloads.patchesServicePacks.viewPatch&amp;PID=17&amp;MetaID=1319" target="_blank">ESRI has announced</a> that ArcGIS 9.2 Service Pack 3 will be released later this month, and have listed the issues that are addressed in this set of patches.

I only scanned through the "issues addressed" for ArcGIS Server .NET. Here are some of the highlights (for me, at least):
<ul>
	<li>NIM008691 - The Web ADF generates a callback response that updates the same TOC node multiple times. <em>(This is good, but wasn't this problem addressed with the interim TOC patch?)</em></li>
	<li>NIM008846 - When blending services with ArcGIS Online services and not using the Web Mapping application, the services may not display correctly at the initial extent. <em>(Yep, definitely noticed this problem. I've thought that I've fixed this problem several different times, but it seems to continue to pop up. Glad to hear it was a bug, and not just me.)</em></li>
	<li>NIM009378 - A number of significant changes have been made to improve discussion topics related to ArcGIS Server .NET development. This is an updated version of the ArcGIS Server .NET Developer Help for 9.2 SP3. <em>(Good to hear.)</em></li>
</ul>
There aren't nearly as many fixes as there were with Service Pack 2, but there weren't nearly as many fixes needed after Service Pack 2, so it kind of makes sense. I've said it before, but I'll say it again: Overall, I've been impressed with the stability of ArcGIS Server after the release of SP2. There are still some issues that need to be addressed, but,  in my opinion, it is getting to be a fairly solid product.

I'm just hoping that with all of the promised new functionality coming out in the 9.3 release it will be a more solid product from the beginning. We had some major headaches working with the initial release of 9.2, and I'd really like to avoid having to go through that again.
