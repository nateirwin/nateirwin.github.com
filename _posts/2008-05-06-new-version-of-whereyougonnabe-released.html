Yesterday, a bit more than three weeks after our initial public release, we released a new version of <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/whereyougonnabe" target="_blank">whereyougonnabe</a>. In case you missed my earlier posts about whereyougonnabe, I'll briefly describe the system and what it strives to do:

whereyougonnabe is a web application (it is currently tied to Facebook, but in the near future we're going to take it outside of the Facebook environment, including a soon-to-be-released mobile-friendly version and integration with other social networking communities) that helps you meet your friends more often. Of course, that's just the tag line, so I'll go a bit deeper. Basically you tell our system where/when you are going to be in the future and we then analyze your "activity", compare it to the "activities" of your friends, and notify you of possible serendipitous moments. whereyougonnabe differentiates between local and global activities, allowing us to filter out some "interactions" while notifying you of "interactions" that we think you'll find of interest. And, on top of this, we use a granular spatial model to help us identify "interactions" - something that none of our competitors do very well. These things combined allow whereyougonnabe to do some really cool things.

With our initial release, we worked on building a solid foundation to support our core application. It took us about six months to get things to the point where we felt confident about releasing to the public (with a 1.0.0 release). Well, here we are three weeks later and we just released a new version (1.1.0). With this release, we are *finally getting to the point where we can start adding on some cool features (outside of the "core" functionality) that we think will make whereyougonnabe even more useful. Of course, in addition to adding new features, we've also enhanced some of the existing features and taken care of quite a few bugs. You can get the full details about this new release at <a href="http://blog.whereyougonnabe.com" target="_blank">whereyougonnabe's blog</a>, but I'll list the highlights here:
<ul>
	<li>Full support for Safari - this was requested by quite a few of our users, so if you were holding back because you use Safari exclusively, you can now check whereyougonnabe out. We now support both Safari for Mac and Safari for Windows.</li>
	<li>Email notifications for new interactions - what good are new "interactions" that occur between you and your friends if you don't know about them? Well, we're taking care of this for you by sending a daily archive of any new interactions to you. Of course, if you don't have any new interactions we won't send you an email and you can always opt out of this service. We do, however, encourage you to stay subscribed, as we think that this feature will truly help you meet your friends more often.</li>
	<li>Better Facebook integration - we are now taking advantage of some of the integration points that Facebook gives us access to, including a new profile widget. If you're currently a user, the widget should show up on your profile the next time you use whereyougonnabe. If you're not yet a user, the widget will show up on your profile when you add our application and use it for the first time. We are also working on more integration points, including using Facebook's mini-feed and status features. Look for these features to be pushed out to whereyougonnabe in the very near future (likely by the end of this week).</li>
	<li>Usability improvements - we've improved whereyougonnabe's saved locations feature that allows you to re-use previously created activities. We now do a full-text search on your previously created activities, making it easier to create an activity within our system.</li>
	<li>General bug fixes - we've taken care of quite a few bugs, and improved our session handling in general - which we expect will make the system more stable. Some of these fixes will be more evident than others, but all of them should improve the overall experience of using whereyougonnabe.</li>
</ul>
There's lots more coming. We're currently focused on making it easier for whereyougonnabe's users to create activities, and should have some news on calendar integration (iCal, Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook) soon.

Here are some screenshots of the features discussed above:
