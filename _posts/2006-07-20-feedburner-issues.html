I apologize for the issues that I'm having with my feed. My recent blogs haven't parsed correctly at <a href="http://feedvalidator.org" target="_blank">Feed Validator</a>, and they are missing most of the text at my <a href="http://www.feedburner.com" target="_blank">Feedburner</a> feed.  RSS readers, however, seem to be displaying the feed correctly. I am working on the issue and hope to get it resolved quickly. Any tips/suggestions would be appreciated!
