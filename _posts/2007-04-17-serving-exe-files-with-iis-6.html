A short pointer: IIS 6 will - by design - only serve .exe files if the following conditions are met:
<ol>
	<li>The directory that is serving the executable(s) must <strong>NOT</strong> have "Scripts and Executables" permission</li>
	<li>The .exe MIME type must be registered with IIS (it is registered, by default)</li>
</ol>
I'm writing this because I've been through this issue before, but forgot about the "Scripts and Executables" permission - one of those 'duh' moments. Maybe this will help someone else remember.
