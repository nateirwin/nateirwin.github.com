<p>From a piece in The Atlantic,Â <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/print/2011/06/how-i-failed-failed-and-finally-succeeded-at-learning-how-to-code/239855/editor-content.html?cs=utf-8">How I Failed, Failed, and Finally Succeeded at Learning How to Code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think that goes a long way toward explaining why so many programmers are self-taught. Sharing solutions to programming problems is easy, perhaps easier than sharing solutions to anything else, because the medium of information exchange -- text -- is the medium of action. Code is its own description. There's no translation involved in making it go."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great read on how one person learned to program, and it is also a a scathing criticism on the state of Computer Science programs across the country. As a "non-traditional" programmer -- I learned to write code on my own and studied Political Science in college -- I'll have to say that this article really hit home. Sure, Computer Science can be learned in a traditional environment, but there are so many resources available on the web today that I would find it difficult to justify paying for a degree to learn how to write code.</p>
