I caught this one from <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a>. Up until now, NPR's wonderfully intelligent show, This American Life, was only available on streaming connections or via <a href="http://www.audible.com" target="_blank">Audible.com</a> - for a fee, of course. Now the most recent show is being released weekly as a podcast. To get to archived shows, you still have to pay $.95 per show to Audible.com or iTunes.

This is great news! I wish that I had the time to sit down every week, at the same time, and listen to This American Life on my local NPR station (<a href="http://www.kunc.org/" target="_blank">KUNC</a>) - but I simply don't. Now I'll be able to listen whenever I have the time and inclination.
