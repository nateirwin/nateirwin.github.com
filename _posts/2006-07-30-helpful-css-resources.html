I have been learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) as I go while working on this site. They have saved me much time and grief; I can't believe that I ever did any design without them! While learning, I have run into a number of helpful resources scattered across the net. Here they are, in no order whatsoever:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.ilovejackdaniels.com/cheat-sheets/css-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">CSS Cheat Sheet</a> - available as a downloadable .png or .pdf, this cheatsheet lists all selectors, pseudo-selectors, properties, etc. and presents just about everything you'll need to know on a single page.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.glish.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS Layout Techniques</a> - A great compilation of tips and tricks for creating cross-browser supported CSS style sheets.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.intensivstation.ch/en/templates/" target="_blank">CSS Templates</a> - Free-to-use CSS templates that can be tweaked and extended to meet your needs.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a> - Beautiful examples of CSS in action with viewable style sheets and HTML.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.dezwozhere.com/links.html" target="_blank">Holy CSS Zeldman!</a> - An authoritative collection of links to CSS resources.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/2006/02/16/practical-web-development-tips/" target="_blank">Squeaky Clean CSS</a> - a blog entry written by Lokesh Dhaka that offers some great pointers on making sure that your CSS stays organized and useable.</li>
	<li><a href="http://bluerobot.com/web/layouts/default.asp" target="_blank">The Layout Reservoir</a> - More simple and extendable CSS templates.</li>
</ul>
Overall, I have learned that it is best to modify CSS templates a step at a time. After each modification, I view the results of the change and further tweak my modifications, if necessary. This allows me to learn step-by-step and see the direct consequences of the changes that I make to the CSS.

Learning from someone else's style sheets also helps, as you almost always pick up at least one new design tip in the process.
