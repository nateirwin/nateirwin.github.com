The Microsoft ASP.NET AJAX development team released their first (and they say, only) release candidate <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">yesterday</span><span style="color: #000000;"> on December 15th</span></span>. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/12/15/asp-net-ajax-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx" target="_blank">Here's the announcement</a>.

They have also updated the AJAX Control Toolkit - a collection of ASP.NET AJAX-enabled controls - and made it available for <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=AtlasControlToolkit" target="_blank">download on CodePlex</a>.

I've written a couple of times about my experiences with the ASP.NET AJAX extensions, and know that I will continue to use them in my web apps. Overall, I have been impressed with the speed of development on this project and the number of feature enhancements and issues addressed over the last several months. I do, however, look forward to that final release, as it'll be nice to stop worrying about upgrading my applications for each new release (I know, I know, my fault for using pre-production software).

On a slightly different, but related, note: I briefly mentioned Microsoft's release of Visual Studio 2005 SP1 last week. I didn't, however, have time to really dive into the changes that SP1 brought to the IDE (Visual Studio, all editions, and Visual Web Developer). Over the last week, though, I've noticed a major improvement that warrants mention, especially to ASP.NET AJAX developers; much improved Intellisense support for the ASP.NET AJAX extensions!
