This post has nothing to do with GIS or IT, or - for that matter - anything that I usually write about. It is, however, just as (if not more) important than most topics and issues that I regularly cover.

This week is the American Library Association's "<a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bannedbooksweek.htm" target="_blank">Banned Books Week</a>". Speaking personally, many (if not most) of the books that have had the greatest impact on my life are those that are on the ALA's <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/reasonsbanned.htm" target="_blank">challenged or banned</a> list. To me, the books that challenge my own personal convictions and make me truly examine myself as a person are those that I consider truly great. Just looking at the challenged and banned list, I can say that the following books have had a direct impact on my personal development over the last twenty or so years:
<ul>
	<li>Aldous Huxley - A Brave New World</li>
	<li>Ernest Hemingway - A Farewell to Arms</li>
	<li>Ernest Hemingway - For Whom the Bell Tolls</li>
	<li>Upton Sinclair - The Jungle</li>
	<li>George Orwell - 1984</li>
	<li>Harper Lee - To Kill A Mockingbird</li>
	<li>J.D. Salinger - Catcher in the Rye</li>
	<li>John Steinbeck - Of Mice and Men</li>
	<li>John Steinbeck - The Grapes of Wrath</li>
	<li>Joseph Conrad - Heart of Darkness</li>
	<li>Joseph Heller - Catch-22</li>
	<li>Ken Kesey - One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</li>
	<li>Truman Capote - In Cold Blood</li>
	<li>Vladimir Nabokov - Lolita</li>
	<li>William Golding - The Lord of the Flies</li>
	<li>William Faulkner - As I Lay Dying</li>
</ul>
Other favorites:
<ul>
	<li>Aldo Leopold - A Sand County Almanac</li>
	<li>Charles Dickens - A Tale of Two Cities</li>
	<li>Edward Abbey - Desert Solitaire</li>
	<li>Ernest Hemingway - The Old Man and the Sea</li>
	<li>Erich Maria Remarque - All Quiet on the Western Front</li>
	<li>Jack Kerouac - Desolation Angels</li>
	<li>Jack Kerouac - On the Road</li>
	<li>Jack Kerouac - The Town and the City</li>
	<li>James Agee - A Death in the Family</li>
	<li>John Muir - My First Summer in the Sierras</li>
	<li>Kate Chopin - The Awakening</li>
	<li>Leo Tolstoy - Anna Karenina</li>
	<li>Leo Tolstoy - War and Peace</li>
	<li>Marcel Proust - Swan's Way</li>
	<li>Mark Twain - The Innocents Abroad</li>
	<li>Vladimir Nabokov - Pale Fire</li>
</ul>
I didn't mean to make the list so long, but, to be honest, I could go on and on. To reminisce like this makes me want to go out and read a great book. In addition to those listed above, I've read a number of great modern pieces of literature. Any good suggestions?
