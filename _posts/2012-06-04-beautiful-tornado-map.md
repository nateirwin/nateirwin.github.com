A beautiful map from IDV Solutions of the last fifty-six years of U.S. tornado tracks. From the [introductory blog post](http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2012/06/zazzle-print-tornado-tracks.html):

<blockquote><p>Got this data from NOAA via the spectacular Data.gov.  It tracks 56 years of tornado paths along with a host of attribute information.  Here, the tracks are categorized by their F-Scale (which isn't the latest and greatest means but good enough for a hack like me), where brighter strokes represent more violent storms.
Here it is broken out by scale.</p></blockquote>
