Tonight I was almost at a breaking point with my newest Windows Vista Ultimate home installation. I've had it installed on my main machine at home for about a month now, and everything has worked flawlessly. Vista Ultimate x64's performance has been more stable and better than XP x64 running on the same hardware. I never ran into any driver issues (which seems to be a common complaint for those who try to run any 64-bit operating system, and especially for those who try to run Vista x64), and never had any stability problems.

Then last night when I tried to boot it down, it hung. No biggie, right? Happens all the time (you can tell I'm a PC user). Well, when I booted back up today I noticed that one of my CPUs was constantly pegged even though there weren't any major processes running. Video performance was also choppy and I couldn't get any audio to play.

I tried everything that I could think of, including registry cleans, spyware scans, and antivirus scans (which forced me to install antivirus software on my machine, something I've been avoiding and will likely reverse here in the next few hours), but I couldn't find anything wrong with the machine.

Suddenly I remembered hearing about some upcoming batch fixes for Windows Vista. With the number of problems that these releases were claiming to solve, some pundits actually starting referring to them as "Service Pack 1" although Microsoft has publicly said that Service Pack 1 won't be released until the final release of Windows Server 2008, which is currently scheduled for February of 2008. After a little bit of searching, I read that these fixes had not yet been publicly released, but that they were available to private beta testers only. You'll understand, then, why I was pleasantly surprised to find links to them during a Google search. It looks like Microsoft just released them to the public today.

So I downloaded and installed them, and oh am I glad I did. After installing 938194 all of my problems disappeared. CPU activity was back to normal, the choppiness disappeared from video, and I got my sound back. I then installed 938979 and everything continued to work! Granted, it's sad that I have to be happy about fixes for problems that should've been fixed in one of the pre-releases, but my expectations at this point are fairly low when it comes to dealing with the behemoths of software. I'm just glad now when problems get acknowledged and fixed.

The point of this story? If you're working with Vista and experiencing video performance issues or really any other problems, I suggest downloading and installing the patches. They saved my night (although, luckily, I do have a recent image that I could've gone back to, if needed - something else that I highly suggest [see the <a href="http://www.nateirwin.net/My+Favorite+Applications+And+Tools.aspx" target="_blank">Imaging section of my tools list</a>]). Here are links to the fixes:
