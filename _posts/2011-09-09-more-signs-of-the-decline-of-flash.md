title: More signs of the decline of Flash
---

According to <a href="http://appendto.com/jquery-overtakes-flash">.appendTo()</a>, jQuery is now deployed on more sites than Flash, via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/09/09/jquery-flash">John Gruber.

And Adobe seems to be <a href="http://gigaom.com/apple/the-day-apple-won-the-flash-fight/">throwing in the towel</a> (or finally facing reality?), via <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/10002040936/the-day-apple-won-the-flash-fight">MG Siegler</a>.

I still think there is a market for Flash, but the number of use cases that require or are best addressed by Flash is shrinking rapidly.
