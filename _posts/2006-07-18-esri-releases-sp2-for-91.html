<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Just found out that ESRI released service pack 2 for ArcGIS Desktop 9.1, ArcIMS 9.1, &amp; ArcSDE 9.1 on the 13th. Not sure how I missed seeing this before, although I didn't receive any notification from them. Anyways, remember to keep all of your installs in sync.</span></span>
