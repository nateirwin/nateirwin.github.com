<span class="drop_cap">I</span> like the idea of social networking (heck, I'm building a <a href="http://www.whereyougonnabe.com" target="_blank">spatially-enabled social networking app</a>), but am still struggling with the idea of managing multiple social networks at the same time. I mean who uses only Facebook? And the complexity grows even more when you start to consider all of the other web apps that you use to manage your life (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28959307@N05/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> is a big one for me).

So when I heard about <a href="http://ping.fm" target="_blank">Ping.fm</a>, I must admit I was intrigued. Ping.fm looks to make all of your social networks manageable by allowing you to update all of them through a single toolset. Makes sense, huh?

So I started to integrate all of my social networks into Ping.fm, but quickly had to make some decisions about what kind of content (status updates, micro-blogging, pictures, location updates, blog posts, etc.) I wanted to send to each individual system. So here is what I settled on:
<ul>
	<li>Status updates ("I'm feeling sad, but happy.", "About to take the dogs on another adventure.", etc.) go to most of the apps. This includes Facebook, Brightkite, LinkedIn, Plaxo, etc. Notice I didn't list Twitter. There's a reason for that.</li>
	<li>Micro-blogging ("Really interesting read at nateirwin.net", "Why does ESRI suck so bad?", etc.) go to Twitter. I've decided to make Twitter and FriendFeed my outlets for work-related random thoughts. No reason that I see to post status updates here.</li>
	<li>Pictures go nowhere. I manage all of my photos using completely separate tools and want to keep them separate from the rest of this stuff. That said, there is definitely a need for the ability to put random pictures on the web. I'll need to think about this more.</li>
	<li>Location updates go to all systems that support them just because I think it is really cool to let others know where I am.</li>
	<li>Blog posts also go nowhere. I will continue to post directly to my blog here (and one that is about to get started over at <a href="http://nispatial.com" target="_blank">http://nispatial.com</a>), and don't want to "muddy the waters" of my social networks with professional blog posts. As for personal blog posts, I have a private area that I share with my friends, but am not really interested in making those public at this point.</li>
</ul>
So there it is. My online communication plan laid out for all to see. I'd be interested in hearing from others who have thought through this.
