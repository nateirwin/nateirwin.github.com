It looks like Microsoft is looking to release version 6 of its Virtual Earth map control around the middle of this month. This version includes both new features and enhancements to existing features. So far, they've disclosed that the following new features and enhancements will be included in this release:
<ul>
	<li>Enhanced geocoding</li>
	<li>Multipoint routing</li>
	<li>Safari browser support</li>
	<li>Localized driving directions</li>
</ul>
I'm especially excited about the multipoint routing and support for Safari.

There have also been rumors of <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/2007/07/microsoft-virtual-earth-to-support-kml.html" target="_blank">KML support</a>, though I haven't heard any official word about this.

It's safe (I think) to assume that this new version of the map control will also provide some fixes in Virtual Earth's 3d capability. I certainly hope so, at least, as we have some projects that really need to utilize 3d in the browser, but have held off on moving too far with them, as there are still some critical issues with the browser (especially Firefox) plugin.
