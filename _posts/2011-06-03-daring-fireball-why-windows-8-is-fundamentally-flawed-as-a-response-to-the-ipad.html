<p>John Gruber:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The ability to run Mac OS X apps on the iPad, with full access to the file system, peripherals, etc., would make the iPad worse, not better. The iPad succeeds because it has eliminated complexity, not because it has covered up the complexity of the Mac with a touch-based 'shell'."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I haven't purchased an iPad yet. I have a Kindle for reading and my MacBook Pro for everything else. Where would the iPad fit? Famous last words?</p>
