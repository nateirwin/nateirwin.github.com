In the past, figuring out how to effectively debug web applications was one of the more difficult hurdles a developer had to overcome when first starting to build web applications. Back then (just a few short years ago) solid web debugging tools were basically non-existent; Internet Explorer's developer tools stunk, Chrome didn't exist, and Safari only ran on OS X. Even the holy grail of web developer tools, Firebug, was buggy at times, although it was by far the best available option.

Oh how things have changed! Web developers today have their choice of top-notch debugging tools that support pretty much every available browser/operating system configuration. Firebug is still a great tool, but now Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer all have their own toolsets. In addition, third party vendors like dynaTrace are building tools that make it easy to debug and performance test complex web applications, a ton of work is being done on documenting best practices and performance techniques, and frameworks are being written to make it easier to write web applications that perform consistently across browser versions. In short, the debugging tools, information, and frameworks available today make writing code for the web much more enjoyable.

I always keep an eye on the Chromium blog because the Google Chrome team is one of the groups that have really pushed web development toolsets forward over the last couple of years. The developer tools available in Chrome are second to none, and I have found myself using them more than Firebug over the last year.

This latest announcement, "Remote debugging with Chrome Developer Tools", shows just how far Chrome's developer tools have come. If you're a web developer and haven't checked them out lately, you might want to take another look!
