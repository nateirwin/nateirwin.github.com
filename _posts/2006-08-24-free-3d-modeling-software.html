DAZ has made their Bryce 5.0 3D modeling and rendering software available for <a href="http://www.daz3d.com/program/bryce/bryce5free.php" target="_blank">free download</a> through September 6th (their newest version is 5.5). This software package allows you to create 3D environments, including landscapes and animations, through a robust and fairly intuitive interface. You do have to register for a serial number, but, there is no charge for the software!

What's with all these 3D products? (Thanks, Roland, for the info.)
