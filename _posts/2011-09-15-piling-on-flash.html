<p>I really don't mean to <a href="http://www.nateirwin.net/2011/09/09/more-signs-of-the-decline-of-flash/">pile on</a>, but there is a lot of noise today about <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/14/metro-style-browsing-and-plug-in-free-html5.aspx">this announcement</a> from Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Running Metro style IE plug-in free improves battery life as well as security, reliability, and privacy for consumers. Plug-ins were important early on in the web’s history. But the web has come a long way <a style="color: #0066dd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI#History" target="_blank">since then</a> with HTML5. Providing compatibility with legacy plug-in technologies would detract from, rather than improve, the consumer experience of browsing in the Metro style UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about Silverlight? Take a look at the comments to see some gems from angry Silverlight developers. Did they not see this coming?</p>
<p>Surely anyone who keeps up with tech news at all saw this coming. Microsoft has been shifting direction for close to a year now, and Flash's deployment rate on major websites is falling rapidly. Not to mention the fact that most major websites have already shifted away from using plugins - especially when doing new development.</p>
