<span style="color: #000000;">
So, I have pieced together the initial (and I say initial because I know that there will be changes coming) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> layout for my site. I used this dasBlog theme, essence, which was designed by <a href="http://jelle.druyts.net">Jelle Druyts</a>, to put together the non-blog sections of the site. It isn't perfect, but it gets the job done for now.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Although there is still a major lack in content, the site is now functional. My next big project is putting together the photo album. Once this is done, I am going to connect <a href="http://del.icio.us/nathaniel.irwin">my del.icio.us links</a> to the site and then work on a membership/roles system, and - if I'm feeling crazy enough - maybe even try to connect it into the login system that comes integrated with this dasBlog application.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Maybe after all of this is done I'll be able to sit back and write some blogs. Until then!
