<blockquote>Happiness is the most important metric in personal tech. If it improves lives, it is important. I've always suspected that sitting around on the internet was a sort of rot, but I had no proof until I read this piece on the Stanford study. I just don't know why this research isn't getting as much attention from reporters as new iPads, CEO changes, earnings reports, acquisitions, and other bullshit that only affects the greedy. People think I'm crazy for complaining about tech news and how stupid and boring the mass media internet has become, but I think they're wrong. And I think most are writing about the wrong things.</blockquote>
<p>A great read from Brian Lam. I've spent a lot of time lately thinking about the intersection between life and tech. I started to realize that I spend too much time interacting with technology when I compared the amount of time I'm on "gadgets" today to the amount of time I spent using "gadgets" five years ago. There's no doubt that technology has improved my life, but I have also let it negatively impact portions of my life.</p>
