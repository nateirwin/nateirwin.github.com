<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Welcome to the blog at <a href="http://www.nateirwin.net">nateirwin.net</a>. As I'm sure you can see, this site is still undergoing a lot of initial development. There are bugs everywhere, and important tweaks that still need to be made. When I get everything set to my liking, I plan on using this <a href="http://www.dasblog.com">dasBlog</a> space to talk about the things that interest me - from my personal interests (books, music, running, soccer) to my professional interests (databases, geographic information systems, information technology, programming). These are obviously broad topics, but I hope to occasionally narrow the focus down to specific areas of interest for extended periods of time. For example, in the near future I plan on writing a series of blogs about my experiences with open source geospatial technologies.

<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">I especially appreciate any comments/tips. The site is currently functional (albeit not all that pretty) so feel free to post in this space. And, if you decide to post, let me know of any bugs that you run into while using the interface.

<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Thanks! and I look forward to interacting with you all.</span>
