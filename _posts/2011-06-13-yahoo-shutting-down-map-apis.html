<p>From the Yahoo! Developer Network blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of Yahoo!â€™s commitment to creating deeply personal digital experiences, we have been reprioritizing our current portfolio of mapping products to refocus on a great consumer Mapping and Local Search experience. After careful consideration, Yahoo! will no longer support the below Maps APIs as of Sept 13, 2011. However, we are continuing to invest in our core maps offering at Yahoo! and later this year will announce more details of our strategic partnership with Nokia, so stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No surprises here.</p>
