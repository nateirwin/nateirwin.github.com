<p>I was, and I had a really hard time figuring out how to bring it back online. You see, VMware Fusion doesn't handle running out of disk space gracefully; it just pauses the virtual machine and won't let you get back in until disk space is freed up. On top of this, and this is the real kicker, VMware Fusion doesn't give you any sort of warning before you get to an un-bootable state.</p>
<p>After furiously browsing the web looking for answers, I discovered the solution that worked best for me.</p>
<p>The problem: I had snapshots turned on, and it turns out that VMware Fusion was creating a bunch of snapshots, but wasn't getting rid of any of them, even after I deleted them. This caused my .vmdk file to balloon to close to 80GB while my operating system only needed about 30GB. Not good.</p>
<p>The solution: To begin with, I turned off snapshots. I only use my Windows virtual machine for a few targeted tasks, and I can live with backing my code up manually and doing a fresh install if something becomes corrupted. To solve the bigger problem, I first deleted all of the existing snapshots. Then I moved my virtual machine to an external hard drive, made sure that VMware Fusion was aware of the move, ran a fresh snapshot (you'll need some space to do this, which is why I moved it to an external hard drive first), and then immediately deleted the snapshot. This seemed to clean up all of the "orphaned" snapshot files, and freed up that extra ~50GB of space I was so sorely missing.</p>
<p>I'm eagerly awaiting the day when large solid-state drives become more affordable!</p>
