A quick followup to a post I made a couple of weeks ago about "<a href="http://www.nateirwin.net/Improving+A+Web+Applications+Page+Load+Time+And+Responsiveness.aspx" target="_blank">Improving a Web Application's Page Load Time and Responsiveness</a>": Thanks to <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/PerformanceTipsFromYahoo.aspx" target="_blank">Omar Shahine</a>, I just discovered Yahoo!'s "<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html" target="_blank">Thirteen Simples Rules for Speeding Up Your Web Site</a>". I linked to the Yahoo! User Interface Blog in my <a href="http://www.nateirwin.net/Improving+A+Web+Applications+Page+Load+Time+And+Responsiveness.aspx" target="_blank">performance blog post</a>, but failed to mention the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Developer Network</a> (YDN).

The YDN is another great resource for web developers. It provides tons of helpful tips and real-world examples to help developers build better web applications. The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" target="_blank">Yahoo! User Interface</a> (YUI) library is probably my favorite resource that the YDN provides.

The YUI is a set of CSS libraries and  elegant JavaScript controls that are made available under the BSD license for all to use. The JavaScript outperforms the controls delivered with Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX control toolkit (I know, in a way it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges, but I'm talking about quality here), and the documentation and community that support the controls are both organized and helpful. Over the last couple of months, I have made it a practice to include the YUI "core CSS foundation" in all of my web applications, as they make developing standards-compliant and consistent websites *much easier. If you didn't know, all browsers have their own built-in CSS quirks that, if not neutralized, can make web design a very frustrating process. If you include YUI's "core CSS foundation" in your application, these quirks are neutralized from the beginning, meaning that you can truly start developing (building) on level ground.

Another cool YDN resource that I just discovered is the "YSlow" Plugin for Firefox. It integrates directly with my favorite Firefox web development add-on, Firebug, and is an extremely helpful way to judge how your website lives up to the "Thirteen Simple Rules" mentioned above. After using it to analyze this site (<a href="http://www.nateirwin.net" target="_blank">nateirwin.net</a>), I know that I definitely need to spend more time optimizing it (as I've known for quite some time), and I'll try to make this a higher priority. The site is scheduled for a complete overhaul here in the near future anyways, so maybe I'll wait until then.

Well, I could sing YDN's praises all night, but I'll save that for a dedicated post later on.
