<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">This entry is simply a test of dasBlog's "mail to weblog"
feature. This feature allows me to post to my blog by simply sending an email to a predefined address. The picture that you are - hopefully - seeing in this post was attached to the email.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>Note: I had to edit the post a bit after it was brought into the blog, as I failed to read the instructions on how to add categories to the blog post. Also, the attached image was appended to the bottom of this post - which makes sense. I, however, wanted it to sit at the top. This is more a limitation of gmail than it is of dasBlog (unless someone can tell me how to add a picture to the text of an email in gmail).</em></span>
