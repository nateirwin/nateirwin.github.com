<p>I don't think I've ever written about a mobile application before, but today I downloaded two awesome new iOS applications, and I wanted to share the news:</p>
<ol>
<li>Readability - I've been waiting on this one for a long time. I was a long time Instapaper user until Readability came along. I converted because of the polish of their website. Reading is a deeply personal thing, and if I'm going to be reading on an electronic device, the content better look good. The Readability iOS app - and, for that matter, the Readability website too - is as good looking as they come. Needless to say I've been anxiously awaiting the iOS app since the announcement that it was coming a few months ago. Now that I have it in hand, I can say that it has only exceeded my expectations.</li>
<li>Camera Awesome - I used SmugMug back in the good 'ole days, but converted to Flickr several years ago. I didn't convert because of deficiencies in SmugMug itself (I always thought their design was original and compelling), but, rather, because of the lack of integration with the devices and applications I use regularly. When I heard the news today that SmugMug had released a new iOS app, I downloaded it immediately. Now I'm not a photographer, but I can already tell that this app is head-and-shoulders above the other iOS photography apps I've used.</li>
</ol>
