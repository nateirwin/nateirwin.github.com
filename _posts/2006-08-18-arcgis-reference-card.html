<a href="http://www.usgsquads.com" target="_blank">Digital Data Services, Inc.</a> (DDS), a company based in Denver, Colorado, put together a very helpful ArcGIS Reference Card for the 2006 ESRI User's Conference.

It includes common map scales, a UTM diagram of the continental United States, ArcMap editing and troubleshooting tips, and some basic Visual Basic functions and is available for download as a .pdf at the <a href="http://www.neercartography.com/download/ArcGIS_Card.pdf" target="_blank">Neer Cartography website</a>. This could be especially useful to those who only occasionally dabble in the ArcGIS Desktop environment.
