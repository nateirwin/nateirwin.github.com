And we have another JavaScript mapping library to add to our toolset. Leaflet joins an already-crowded field of JavaScript mapping libraries, but I, for one, am not complaining! As far as I'm concerned, the more the merrier, and I'm happy to have another open source project to play around with.

It will be interesting to see how these libraries evolve and differentiate themselves from each other. By my count, we now have three open source JavaScript mapping libraries that seem to occupy the same space: Open Layers, Modest Maps JS, and Leaflet (am I missing any others?). It does seem that Modest Maps JS and Leaflet are more focused on staying as lightweight as possible, and this is a good thing. I like libraries that make it easier for me to do things without doing everything for me.

I'll be keeping an eye on Leaflet, and may add support for it to NPMap.
