<span class="drop_cap">I</span>f you've been holding your breath waiting for Google to release Chrome for Mac (or Linux), you can take a breath. It has been a long time coming, but Google finally <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2009/06/danger-mac-and-linux-builds-available.html">announced</a> today that they are releasing "developer" builds for Mac and Linux.

Because of its startup speed (dramatically better than any of the other browsers out there), I've been using Chrome more and more as my primary browser as of late. Once some critical "Add-ons" become available, I'm pretty sure it will become my only browser - assuming that a few improvements are made to the developer tools.

If you are looking for a solid release of Chrome, you'll probably want to hold off for awhile, though, as this is an alpha release that is missing a bunch of critical features. If, however, you just want to play around a bit, you might as well go for it. It is definitely solid enough for most of what I do on the web. In fact, I'm writing this post in it.
