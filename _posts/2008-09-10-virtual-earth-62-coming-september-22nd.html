Just received an early announcement from Microsoft that the next version of the Virtual Earth map control, 6.2, will be released - along with version 1.0 of the Virtual Earth Web Services - on September 22nd. There are some pretty exciting enhancements coming with the new map control, including:
<ul>
	<li>Static maps</li>
	<li>Direct map tile access</li>
	<li>Aerial map imagery metadata</li>
	<li>Pushpin clustering</li>
	<li>Landmark-based directions</li>
	<li>Improved geocoding</li>
	<li>Expanded rooftop geocoding in the US</li>
	<li>Real-time weather integration in 3D</li>
</ul>
In addition to these enhancements/new features, Microsoft is touting "expanded mobile support" and "expanded international features".

I'm most excited about the tile access, imagery metadata, and pushpin clustering. I'm also very interested in learning more about the Virtual Earth Web Services. My Virtual Earth users should be very happy after this release...
