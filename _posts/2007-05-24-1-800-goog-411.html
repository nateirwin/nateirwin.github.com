This one may be more important to me than it is to others, but having just moved to a new city this past September, I find myself dialing 411 more than I'd like from my mobile phone. To be honest, I dialed it quite a bit even before I moved into these new and unexplored areas. Well, Google is proposing a solution to all those extra charges! I found this one on the <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/05/1-800-goog-411-freedom-with-speech.html" target="_blank">Google LatLong</a> blog, but haven't tried it out yet. I'm sure I will, though, in the very near future (tomorrow, and probably the next day, and the next...).
