<p>Catching up on some news from last week. I'm really happy to see that TileMill will be able to run natively on Windows sometime in the next few months. I work on a Mac both at home and at work, but Windows is still the standard for our organization, so this should make it easier for our team to get others interested in using TileMill.</p>
