If you read Peter Batty's early-October <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/2007/10/spatial-networking-is-under-way.html" target="_blank">announcement</a> about the formation of Spatial Networking, Inc., you may already know that I've been working with him on the development of a spatially-focused application built on the Facebook platform. The project has been super-fun to work on, and, after four months of development on it, we're finally getting to a release-worthy product.

Well, today <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/2008/01/coming-out-of-stealth-mode-soon.html" target="_blank">Peter announced</a> (and so now I can announce, as well) that he's going to be giving the first public demo of our application at the <a href="http://newtech.meetup.com/27/" target="_blank">Boulder-Denver New Technology Meetup Group</a> next week.

I can't really go into any detail about what the app does, but I will say that I think we're breaking new ground in the social networking space. If you have any experience with GIS at all, you know the value that can be added to just about any product or service through the integration of spatial data. Well, our application has the same kind of "value add".

We're currently moving towards a very-limited alpha release later this week and then expect to conduct a limited beta test within February. If all things go reasonably well with these releases, we could go live with a public release soon after.

I'll post more as I'm allowed...
