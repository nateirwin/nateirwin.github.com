A quick follow-up to my <a href="http://www.nateirwin.net/2011/05/09/remote-debugging-with-chrome-developer-tools/">last post</a> about Google Chrome's developer tools: Paul Irish's 2011 Google I/O presentation, "Chrome Dev Tools Reloaded" is now up on YouTube. It walks you through a lot of the developer tools' advanced features, and is a must-see, especially if you aren't familiar with the tools.

As I mentioned before, Chrome is slowly becoming my browser of choice for web development.
