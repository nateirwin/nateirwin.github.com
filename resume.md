    <p>
      My first couple of years with the National Park Service were spent as a jack of all trades.

          <h3>NPMap Website</h3>
          <p>
            Re-designed the NPMap team website. The new design fits into the National Park Service look-and-feel, and includes a number of different components, including a gallery, support docs, and a blog. The website is built using a technology called Jekyll, which is a set of Ruby scripts that generate static HTML from Markdown using templates and functions.

            Plan Your Visit
          </h3>
          <p>
            Built a full-screen Plan Your Visit experience for nps.gov from scratch. The initial version was built to help celebrate the Civil War Sesquicentennial, but I kept the architecture flexible so it can be easily extended for other National Park Service subjects and parks. The web map is built on the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/npmap/support/npmap-library.html">NPMap library</a>, and it pulls data in from minified Json files that are created hourly by a console application. Using this innovative technique, I was able to get the initial load down to < 1MB. Pretty impressive given the map tiles and JavaScript resources that are required by the map.

          <p>
            The NPMap team was asked to help re-design the <a href="http://www.nps.gov">nps.gov</a> state pages. The previous version of the pages had simple image maps with hardcoded links to each state's NPS sites. The redesigned pages have fully interactive maps that consume data from a live web service. The data are clustered dynamically on the server, ...
