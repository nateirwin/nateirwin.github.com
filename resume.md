      Developer, designer, and geogeek
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am passionate about creating simple and beautiful information-driven interfaces for the web. I enjoy helping others tell their stories and making information more widely available and accessible through the use of flexible, standards-based designs and the application of innovative technologies and techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      My newest interests include information-design and the intersection of traditional cartography and the web. I am especially interested in doing more work outside of the world of geospatial, although I'll always have a soft spot for maps.

    <h3>
      EGIS & Web Mapping Coordinator, U.S. National Park Service<br>
      September 2006 - Present
    </h3>
    <p>
      My first couple of years with the National Park Service were spent as a jack of all trades. I took on a variety of challenges, including the coordination of enterprise GIS for the service's national office and project management for several high-profile projects. Since 2009, I have focused on leading the NPMap team, which builds web maps for National Park Service parks, programs, and partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Highlights:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Led the NPMap team, a team of four cartographers, developers, designers, and data managers that focuses on building web maps for the National Park Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developed and released the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/npmap/support/npmap-library.html">NPMap library</a>, a JavaScript abstraction library that wraps functionality and a basic API around a number of open source and proprietary web mapping libraries. The NPMap team is currently walking through the process of open sourcing the library.
      </li>
      <li>
        Built over a hundred web maps, from simple embedded maps to advanced fullscreen interfaces, for different National Park Service entities using the NPMap library. Served as the project manager and lead developer on all of these projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coordinated web mapping activities across the National Park Service, including the establishment and maintenance of enterprise license agreements with MapBox, Esri, Bing, and Google for servicewide usage of their mapping services. Also looked for ways to make it easier for NPS employees and partners to build and deploy web maps with custom geospatial data to NPS web pages. The NPMap team is currently developing two systems, a places of interest system and a web map wizard, to support this effort.
      </li>
      <li>
        Presented at multiple internal-NPS and public conferences, including George Wright Society in 2011 and FOSS4G North America in 2012. Will also be presenting at this year's NACIS conference in October.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      President, NI Spatial, LLC<br>
      October 2009 - Present
    </h3>
    <p>
      I formed NI Spatial in late-2008, and since then have performed freelance work for a wide variety of clients. My customer list includes Ubisense, RL Brown, Steel Tower, and Spatial Networking, along with a number of smaller companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Highlights
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Worked on a small startup team to build out a product called "whereyougonnabe". This product integrated with users' calendars and social networks, and alerted them when they were going to be close to their friends and family. Developed and maintained a fully-working system, but eventually pulled the plug after the economy crashed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Helped build enterprise class web mapping systems for Ubisense and Steel Tower Data. These systems fully-integrated into existing company/customer databases and processes, and helped them better manage their information and respond to customer needs.

          <h3>NPMap Website</h3>
          <p>
            Re-designed the NPMap team website. The new design fits into the National Park Service look-and-feel, and includes a number of different components, including a gallery, support docs, and a blog. The website is built using a technology called Jekyll, which is a set of Ruby scripts that generate static HTML from Markdown using templates, functions, and plugins.

            Plan Your Visit
          </h3>
          <p>
            Built a full-screen Plan Your Visit experience for nps.gov from scratch. The initial version was built to help the National Park Service celebrate the Civil War Sesquicentennial, but we kept the architecture flexible and we are about to extend the scope to parks and other subjects. The web map is built on the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/npmap/support/npmap-library.html">NPMap library</a>, and it pulls data in from minified JSON files created hourly by a console application and cached in the NPS content delivery network. Using this innovative technique, we were able to get the initial load to less than 1MB. Pretty impressive given the map tiles and JavaScript resources required by the map.

            State Pages
          </h3>
          <p>
            The NPMap team was asked to help re-design the <a href="http://www.nps.gov">nps.gov</a> state pages. The previous version of the pages had simple image maps with hardcoded links to each state's NPS sites. The redesigned pages have fully interactive maps that consume data from a web service. The overlay data are served as vector tiles, and are clustered dynamically on the server then cached aggressively on both the client and server. This approach allows us to maintain great performance while still pulling data from a dynamic database of over 100,000 records.
