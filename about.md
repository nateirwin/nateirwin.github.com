# Hello, my name is Nate.

I've worked in a variety of roles for the [U.S. National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov) since graduating from the University of Tennessee in 2004. I'm currently the head of the [NPMap](http://www.nps.gov/npmap) team. We work on web maps for NPS parks, programs, and regions. I also do some freelance work for a few other companies, helping them create and maintain high-quality geospatial products.

I spend time outside of work enjoying [beautiful Colorado](http://fuckyeahcolorado.tumblr.com/). My other interests include trail running, playing soccer, snow skiing, listening to live music, and messing around with new technologies.

I am not looking for work opportunities, but feel free to get in touch if you want to chat or catch up: nate at nateirwin.net. You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nateirwin) and [GitHub](http://github.com/nateirwin).
