# Hello, my name is Nate.

I've worked in a variety of roles for the [U.S. National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov) since graduating from the University of Tennessee in 2004. I currently lead the [NPMap](http://www.nps.gov/npmap) team. We work on web maps for NPS parks, programs, and regions. I also do some freelance work for a few other companies, helping them create and maintain high-quality geospatial products.

I spend my time outside of work enjoying [beautiful Colorado](http://fuckyeahcolorado.tumblr.com/). My other interests include trail running, playing soccer, snow skiing, listening to live music, and messing around with new technologies.

I am not looking for work opportunities, but feel free to get in touch if you want to chat or catch up: nate at nateirwin.net. You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nateirwin) and [GitHub](http://github.com/nateirwin).

And lastly, I hope it goes without saying, but I'm going to say it anyways: All content on this site is written by me as an individual, and does not represent the views or opinions of my employer, the National Park Service, or any other company I'm doing work for.
