Firebug is a web developer's best friend. Without it, there are times when we'd be absolutely lost. Luckily it is actively developed and well-supported.

The 1.1 beta version was released in the middle of February, but I'm just getting around to upgrading to it. Until I started to actively use Firefox 3, I didn't see much of a need to upgrade (Firebug 1.1 can be installed on Firefox 3), but boy was I wrong. There are a couple of big additions that make this a must-have upgrade for me:
<ul>
	<li>eval() debugging - this is the big one. I can't tell you how many times I've run into cryptic issues using the eval() statement. Firebug 1.1 handles this by displaying code sent to eval() in the Script panel as a new source file. This code can then be debugged just like any other JavaScript in Firebug. If you don't want to debug eval() code, you can always turn this option off. You'll get better performance with it turned off.</li>
	<li>Aptana IDE editor integration - I use Aptana's Eclipse plugin for all of my CSS, HTML, and JavaScript coding, and integration between Aptana and Firebug only makes my life that much easier.</li>
	<li>Cache tab for Net panel - this should make it easy to verify if a resource is cached or not.</li>
	<li>Supports Firefox 3 - already mentioned this one above, but thought it should be mentioned again.</li>
</ul>
