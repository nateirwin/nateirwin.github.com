<p>A clever little Mac app that monitors your Markdown file, as you work on it in real-time, and gives you an instant preview of it.</p>
<p>We are now writing all of <a href="http://maps.nps.gov/support">NPMap's help documentation</a> (which still needs a ton of work, so don't hate!) in Markdown, so I'm sure I'll be using this app several times a day.</p>
<p>It's just $2.99 in the Mac App Store.</p>
