<span class="drop_cap">J</span>ust a quick note for myself (and also for those of you who might be looking for a solution to a frustrating problem): If you are developing with the Cassini web server on Windows 7 and notice *major performance problems when using Firefox to load the local site, try out this fix. It worked for me!

EDIT: The link above is down at the moment. Here are the instructions:

<ol>
<li>Open Firefox and type "about:config" in the address bar.</li>
<li>Use the textbox at the top to filter on "v6."</li>
<li>Double-click on the "ipv6" setting.</li>
</ol>
