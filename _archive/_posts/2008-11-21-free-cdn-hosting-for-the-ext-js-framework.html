I'm a little late on this one, but I was just reading through some queued blog posts and <a href="http://extjs.com/blog/2008/11/18/ext-cdn-custom-builds-compression-and-fast-performance/">discovered</a> that Ext has teamed up with CacheFly to host their JavaScript library.

This is big news. I still haven't quite figured out why Google doesn't serve Ext through their "<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/">AJAX Libraries API</a>" (I assume it has something to do with Ext's licensing), but now that we can get it from somewhere else, this is no longer a worry.

Developers using Ext can instantly take advantage of fast delivery and caching by pointing to the resources on CacheFly. Here are the urls for ext-all.js and ext-all.css:

<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://extjs.cachefly.net/ext-2.2/ext-all.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://extjs.cachefly.net/ext-2.2/resources/css/ext-all.css" /&gt;
</pre>

And CacheFly will also host your custom build of Ext, so if you aren't using some of the controls in your application, go and build your own Ext using the <a href="http://extjs.com/products/extjs/build/">Build It!</a> tool. You'll be given the choice to dump the build on CacheFly.
