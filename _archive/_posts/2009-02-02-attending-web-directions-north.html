<p>I'll be at the Web Directions North conference here in Denver today through Thursday of this week.</p>  <p>If you haven't heard about the conference yet, take a look at the schedule at the <a target="_blank" href="http://north.webdirections.org/program">conference site</a>. There are some great workshops and sessions, with some presenters that I highly recommend seeing. And, oh yeah, there is a party on Thursday night at an &quot;undisclosed location&quot; downtown.</p>  <p>If you do happen to be attending, get in touch with me on Twitter (nateirwin).</p>
