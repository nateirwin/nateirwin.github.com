Well, the people of France have apparently <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/5775686">forgiven Zidane</a> for his loss of control in the World Cup final this past Sunday. He, of course, headbutted Italian defender Marco Materazzi 20 minutes into the first overtime period and rumors are flying around as to what Materazzi said to Zidane to set him off.

One statement that really caught my eye was that of Franz Beckenbauer, former German great. He defended Zidane's actions almost immediately after the incident, saying, "Something must have been said to Zidane. He is actually a reserved and inoffensive person." While this statement is not entirely true - Zidane has lost his temper in much the same way several times in the past - it still means a lot.

The best summary that I have found of the incident and the circumstances surrounding it is on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zidane">wikipedia</a>. You can also click on the image of the headbutt above to view video.

<span style="font-size: xx-small;">Update: FIFA has called an investigation of the incident, and is expected to release their decision on the 20th. They have said that Zidane's World Cup Golden Ball could possibly be taken away. I'll let you all know what happens with the investigation.</span>
