<p>Espresso is hands-down my favorite editor for writing websites. I work in a Windows environment for the <a href="http://www.nps.gov">National Park Service</a>, so I find myself working in Windows (via VMWare Fusion) and Visual Studio 2010 quite often. But anytime I can get out of the ASP.NET world, I switch almost immediately over to Espresso and its refreshingly clean interface and styling. It has everything I need and very little I don't.</p>
<p>It had been quite some time since Espresso's last release, so I was beginning to think that MacRabbit was done developing it. Silly me!</p>
