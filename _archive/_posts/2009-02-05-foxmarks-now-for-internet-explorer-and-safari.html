<span class="drop_cap">I</span> just read on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5146921/foxmarks-bookmark-syncing-available-for-ie-safari" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a> that Foxmarks has released versions of its bookmark synchronization utility for Internet Explorer and Safari (for Mac, not yet Windows). This is exciting news, as now I can truly consider using Safari while working on my Mac. On top of this, I can now get my bookmarks onto (and off of) my iPhone). The downside is that the available versions don't include support for Internet Explorer 8, which I've been using because of its vastly improved developer tools, Safari for Windows, or Google Chrome. Oh well, I'm sure it will come soon.

In the past, the limitation of not having my bookmarks available in other browsers has been too much to overcome, so I've consistently stuck with Firefox. I'll probably continue to use Firefox for most of my browsing (Firebug is very important to me), but this just means that there is now one less reason to stick strictly with Firefox.

You can find the <a href="http://download.foxmarks.com/download/all" target="_blank">downloads</a> on the Foxmarks site.
