I really don't mean to <a href="http://www.nateirwin.net/2011/09/09/more-signs-of-the-decline-of-flash/">pile on</a>, but there is a lot of noise today about <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/14/metro-style-browsing-and-plug-in-free-html5.aspx">this announcement</a> from Microsoft:

<blockquote>
<p>
Running Metro style IE plug-in free improves battery life as well as security, reliability, and privacy for consumers. Plug-ins were important early on in the web’s history. But the web has come a long way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI#History">since then</a> with HTML5. Providing compatibility with legacy plug-in technologies would detract from, rather than improve, the consumer experience of browsing in the Metro style UI.

What about Silverlight? Take a look at the comments to see some gems from angry Silverlight developers. Did they not see this coming?

Surely anyone who keeps up with tech news at all saw this coming. Microsoft has been shifting direction for close to a year now, and Flash's deployment rate on major websites is falling rapidly. Not to mention the fact that most major websites have already shifted away from using plugins - especially when doing new development.
