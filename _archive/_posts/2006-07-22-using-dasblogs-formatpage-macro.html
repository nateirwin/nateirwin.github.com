Thanks to Omar Shahine's <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/FormatPageMacroInDasBlog.aspx" target="_blank">great explanation</a>, I was able to get rid of the standard HTML/CSS pages that I had set up for the site. Using dasBlog's FormatPage macro made this simple, as I simply created an HTML page named <span style="color: #ff0000;">XXXXX.format.html</span> and the page displayed with the default layout specified in the theme template page. It's very simple, but works perfectly! Now I don't have to worry about maintaining separate CSS stylesheets or keeping multiple templates in sync.

Because of this newfound simplicity (as you can tell, I think this is <em><strong>really</strong></em> going to make my life easier), I should be adding more content and features to the site over the next few weeks.
