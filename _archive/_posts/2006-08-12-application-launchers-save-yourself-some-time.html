<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Scott Hanselman just recently <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ReplacingStartRunTheQuestContinues.aspx" target="_blank">posted an entry</a> about application launchers. In the entry, he covered the two that I use every day - <a href="http://www.launchy.net" target="_blank">Launchy</a> and <a href="http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/" target="_blank">Slickrun</a>. They work well together, each filling in where the other lacks. I use Launchy to start applications and index local directories and files (you can tell it what directories and type of files you want it to index and let it go on its merry way). Slickrun is much more powerful, but also takes more getting used to. With it, you can browse to shares and create nicknames - or "Magic Words" - and use them to launch applications or URLs.</span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Both utilities are minimal (Launcher hides until you want to use it and Slickrun is a tiny, unobtrusive box that hovers wherever you place it) and have AutoComplete functionality, which really enhances the overall usability.</span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the aforementioned entry, Scott covered several more launcher utilities. I have tried a few of the others (just recently giving up Colibri for Launchy [reason: I wanted more than <em>just</em> an app launcher] and Google Desktop for Slickrun [reason: Google Desktop was too bloated for my tastes]), and will likely try the rest of them out in the near future.</span>

<em><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Note: Launchy is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php" target="_blank">open source</a> and Slickrun is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware" target="_blank">freeware</a>, so there's no reason not to try them!</span></em>
