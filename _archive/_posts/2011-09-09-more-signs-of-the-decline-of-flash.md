title: More signs of the decline of Flash
---

According to [.appendTo()](http://appendto.com/jquery-overtakes-flash), jQuery is now deployed on more sites than Flash, via [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/09/09/jquery-flash).

And Adobe seems to be [throwing in the towel](http://gigaom.com/apple/the-day-apple-won-the-flash-fight/) (or finally facing reality?), via [MG Siegler](http://parislemon.com/post/10002040936/the-day-apple-won-the-flash-fight).

I still think there is a market for Flash, but the number of use cases that require or are best addressed by Flash is shrinking rapidly.
