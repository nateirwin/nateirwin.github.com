I'm not *too tired of it yet, although it's certainly starting to take a toll. The snow just seems to keep lurking around Colorado. We've been in a pattern for the last couple of months: it snows for a couple days, clears up for about five or six, then snows again. At my house (which is at ~9000 feet and located in a notoriously snowy area) we've seen close to ten feet of snow so far this winter and it's been so cold that none of it has gone away. And to top it all off, the wind has been so strong (they measured 120+ mph winds in Wondervu, where I live, during one wind storm earlier this month) that just about everytime I come home I have to shovel - even if it hasn't snowed in days.

I saw a report earlier today, though, that said the weather pattern is changing from El Nino to La Nina. This will hopefully mean that the ski areas get more snow while we get less. <img src="http://www.nateirwin.net/images/moresnow.png" alt="" width="220" height="217" align="left" />Anyway, as you can see from the image it looks like the snow isn't going away quite yet. I can't tell you how many times over the last several months I've seen that exact forecast.

Some weather records that have been set in Denver and the frontrange so far this winter:

<ul>
	<li>3rd snowiest December on record, with 29.4 inches from two major storms and a couple of minor snowfalls.</li>
	<li>8th coldest January on record (average temperature of 22 degrees in Denver so far).</li>
	<li>5th longest period of ground snowcover in Denver on record (over six weeks of snowcover and counting).</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
There's still a possibility that this could be the snowiest winter in history for Denver, although the record of 118.07 inches - set during the snowfall season of 1908-1909 - will be tough to beat. So far the city has received 58 inches of snowfall.
