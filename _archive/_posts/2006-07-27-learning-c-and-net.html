I am about to begin learning C# and am looking for some general self-help books. I can, of course, go onto <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> and look for the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> books, but I was hoping to get a little help with making the decision. I know that an organized, thorough, and well thought-out book can make learning anything a lot easier. Any suggestions? I will, of course, post all that I learn here on the good 'ole blog for others to learn from.

Follow up: I chose to start the learning process with Jesse Liberty and Brian MacDonald's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596102097/nateirwinnet-20" target="_blank"> Learning C# 2005: Get Started with C# 2.0 and .NET Programming (2nd Edition)</a>. It was the only book that I could find that really starts at the basics and builds.
