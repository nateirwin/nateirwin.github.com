This news comes from <a href="http://johanneskebeck.spaces.live.com/Blog/" target="_blank">Hannes's Virtual Earth Blog</a>.

Microsoft has just released several new features into the Virtual Earth API, allowing developers to further enhance their Virtual Earth map control v6 applications:
<ol>
	<li><strong><em>It is now possible to import 3D collections into VEDataType.VECollection.</em></strong></li>
	<li><strong><em>It is now possible to import KML and GPX data into VEDataType.ImportXML.</em></strong> This is obviously great news. We can now consider using KML as a data standard for our organization.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Localized driving directions can now be accessed through the API</em></strong> by adding the market you're interested in (en-us for the United States) to the end of the map control URL (e.g. http://dev.virtualearth.net/mapcontrol/mapcontrol.ashx?v=6&amp;mkt=en-us).</li>
	<li><strong><em>SSL support has been added for the Virtual Earth map control</em></strong> (https://dev.virtualearth.net/mapcontrol/mapcontrol.ashx?v=6). This may not sound like a huge enhancement, but support for SSL is a huge need for enterprise customers. It is a major pain when developers have an SSL-secured application but their users get security warnings when browsing to a page that has an embedded map. I have heard much grumbling among users of the Google Maps API that including SSL support doesn't seem to be a priority for Google. Maybe this is just another demonstration that Virtual Earth is becoming the standard for mapping in the enterprise?</li>
</ol>
