A couple of different downloads, supporting different versions:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=BB4A75AB-E2D4-4C96-B39D-37BAF6B5B1DC" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A9AB638C-04D2-4AEE-8AE8-9F00DD454AB8" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=7B0B0339-613A-46E6-AB4D-080D4D4A8C4E" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2005 Express Editions</a></li>
</ul>
The download for the Standard, Professional, and Team Editions (the first link in the list above) is over 400 MB and, from a few posts that I've read on the web, can be a bit grueling on the OS. It is probably best to run the update at the end of the day.
