<span class="drop_cap">S</span>o sorry to all of you feed subscribers. I finally dug in to see why my content was getting syndicated as partial posts, and when I re-aggregated the feed, Feedburner decided to re-publish a bunch of old posts. Things should be good to go now, and from here on out you should get entire posts delivered to your reader.
