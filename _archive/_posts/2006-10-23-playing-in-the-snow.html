Here at my new home we've already had three or four decent snows. There's been a good covering, probably close to ten inches, on the ground for at least two weeks now; I'm thinking that I may not see the bare ground again this year. I'll admit it - I'm definitely new to this. For the last five years or so out East we were lucky if we got a couple of three inch snows a year. Now I come out here to the mountains of Colorado and move into a cabin at 8500 feet (~UTM 466472.61 East, 4419642.16 North). I'm in for a rude awakening, right? Well, maybe. But at least I'll have fun playing in the snow.

This past weekend kicked off the year's ski season for me. I went up to <a href="http://www.arapahoebasin.com/" target="_blank">Arapahoe Basin</a> with some friends, and waited in line at the only open ski lift with fifteen queues of other skiers/boarders to get to the top of the two open slopes. Oh well, maybe I learned my lesson? Nah, probably not. I'll be there the first chance I get next year, as well. All in all it was still a great time. I got my "ski legs" back, and am itching to get onto those upper slopes.
