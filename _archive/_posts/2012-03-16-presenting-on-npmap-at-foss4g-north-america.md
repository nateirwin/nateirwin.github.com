I found out a few days ago that my session to FOSS4G North America was accepted, so I'll be presenting on Tuesday at 4pm at the conference. The conference is April 10-12 in Washington, D.C., and I must say that [the program](http://foss4g-na.org/schedule) looks pretty solid. I attended FOSS4G here in Denver last year, and learned a lot about the cool stuff that is being done with open sources geospatial software.

Here's the full abstract:

<blockquote><p>The National Park Service builds, maintains, and uses a JavaScript abstraction library called NPMap to build its web maps. This library is built on top of a number of open source projects, including Underscore.js, Modest Maps JS, Twitter’s Bootstrap, and Polymaps. In addition, the NPMap team has embraced open specifications and standards, and is building innovative web maps on top of these standards.<br><br>This talk will focus on a few different topics: the NPMap team’s decision to go open source, how NPMap uses open source software, and the dividends the team has received from the decision to go open source.</p></blockquote>
