I recently upgraded the internal-NPS version of NPMap to ASP.NET MVC 3, and quickly noticed (thanks to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/">ELMAH</a>!) that my Active Directory forms authentication was behaving sporadically. Users were able to successfully log on at times, but occasionally a user would not be able to log on because of an HTTP 500 error: "System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x8007200F): The directory service is unavailable." Another error that occasionally popped up, as well: "System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: The server is not operational."

After digging around the interwebs and not finding anything that solved my problem, I finally opened up my Web.config to take a look around, and realized that I had not updated my membership provider configuration to .NET 4. After making this change, the problem went away.

Lesson learned!
