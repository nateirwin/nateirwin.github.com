An intriguing piece from "This is my next..." on how Google acts as the gatekeeper between OEMs and the Android operating system. The piece contains excerpts from a slew of documents that were recently released as part of Skyhook Wireless' "business interference and patent infringement" case against Google. These documents allow us a (very) brief glimpse into the inner-workings of the secretive company, and even contain email correspondence between Andy Rubin and Motorola's CEO Sanjay Jha.

While the entire article is a must-read, what really piqued my interest is the fact that the lawsuit is all about Google not wanting to give up its ability to build out its database of locations:

"At this point Google had three major concerns about Skyhook XPS: first, that Skyhook devices would somehow contaminate Google’s location database, second, that devices using Skyhook would not contribute to Google location database, and third, that OEMs might continue to choose Skyhook over Google’s location service. What’s interesting about this is that the first and second problems are opposites — although Google’s database wouldn’t be contaminated if Skyhook users weren’t contributing to it, Google was equally worried about the loss of location data. For Google, no data is apparently worse than bad data."
