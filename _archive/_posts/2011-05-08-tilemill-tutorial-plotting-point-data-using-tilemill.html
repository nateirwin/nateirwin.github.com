An excellent walkthrough from the MapBox team on using TileMill to style point data. TheÂ walkthrough contains some good tips on styling and labeling map data in general, along with some specifics about getting good results using TileMill.

I'm currently working in TileMill to create a park boundary dataset for the National Park Service, and will definitely be testing out some of these tricks to see what kind of results I get.
