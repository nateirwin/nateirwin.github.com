Big news coming out from Microsoft this past Monday: They released an early version of their <a href="https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank">Live Mesh</a> platform to a limited group of testers. Live Mesh is basically a system that connects a user's disparate systems (Windows machines, Mac machines, and mobile devices) together, making it extremely easy to share resources between them.
<blockquote>The core philosophy is to make it easy to manage information in a world where people have multiple computing experiences (i.e. PCs and applications, web sites, phones, video games, music and video devices) that they use in the context of different communities (i.e. myself, family, work, organizations).</blockquote>
It looks like Live Mesh is building on the FolderShare idea and implementation. I'm excited to see what comes out of it.

Here's a link to a series of videos that puts it all together: <a title="https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/LearnMore.aspx" href="https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/LearnMore.aspx">https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/LearnMore.aspx</a>.
