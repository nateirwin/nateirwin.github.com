    <title>Beautiful tornado map</title>
    <link href="http://nateirwin.net/beautiful-tornado-map.html"/>
    <updated>2012-06-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://nateirwin.net/beautiful-tornado-map.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A beautiful map from IDV Solutions of the last fifty-six years of U.S. tornado tracks. From the &lt;a href='http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2012/06/zazzle-print-tornado-tracks.html'&gt;introductory blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got this data from NOAA via the spectacular Data.gov.  It tracks 56 years of tornado paths along with a host of attribute information.  Here, the tracks are categorized by their F-Scale (which isn't the latest and greatest means but good enough for a hack like me), where brighter strokes represent more violent storms.
Here it is broken out by scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;img alt='U.S. Tornado Tracks' src='/img/tornado-tracks.jpg' title='tornado-tracks.jpg' style='display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;' /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the interactive version on &lt;a href='http://visual.ly/tornado-tracks'&gt;visual.ly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Google imposing more restrictions on Google Maps API</title>
    <link href="http://nateirwin.net/google-imposing-more-restrictions-on-google-maps-api.html"/>
    <updated>2012-05-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://nateirwin.net/google-imposing-more-restrictions-on-google-maps-api.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Google &lt;a href='http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2012/04/update-to-google-maps-api-deprecation.html'&gt;continues the trend&lt;/a&gt; of tightening down the Google Maps API terms of service. From section 10.1.1.g of the updated &lt;a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/terms'&gt;Google Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Use of Content without a Google Map. You must not use or display the Content without a corresponding Google map, unless you are explicitly permitted to do so in the Maps APIs Documentation, or through written permission from Google. In any event, you must not use or display the Content on or in conjunction with a non-Google map. For example, you must not use geocodes obtained through the Service in conjunction with a non-Google map. As another example, you must not display Street View imagery alongside a non-Google map, but you may display Street View imagery without a corresponding Google map because the Maps APIs Documentation explicitly permits you to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from section 10.2.a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No &quot;Wrapping.&quot; You must not create or offer a &quot;wrapper&quot; for the Service, unless you obtain Google's written consent to do so. For example, you are not permitted to: (i) use or provide any part of the Service or Content (such as map imagery, geocoding, directions, places, or terrain data) in an API that you offer to others; or (ii) create a Maps API Implementation that reimplements or duplicates Google Maps/Google Earth. For clarity, you are not &quot;re-implementing or duplicating&quot; Google Maps/Google Earth if your Maps API Implementation provides substantial additional features or content beyond Google Maps/Google Earth, and those additional features or content constitute the primary defining characteristic of your Maps API Implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say I&amp;#8217;m confused as to why Google is moving in this direction. I understand their desire to move their APIs into the enterprise space, but why do this now when OpenStreetMap is getting so much publicity and the number of viable (and much cheaper) alternatives to Google Maps is growing? It seems like Google would be working to bring in new customers, not push them away by imposing new restrictive limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#8217;t understand why they would ever want to impose these two specific constraints. If a company is paying Google to use their geocoding and routing services, why not let them use these services however they please? And how does &amp;#8220;wrapping&amp;#8221; functionality around the Google Maps API hurt Google&amp;#8217;s business model?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the days of Google Maps being the defacto web mapping platform are gone. If the terms of service don&amp;#8217;t allow me to be creative when using Google&amp;#8217;s APIs, I&amp;#8217;m not going to use them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Amen to this (on Readability and Instapaper)</title>
    <link href="http://nateirwin.net/amen-to-this-on-readability-and-instapaper.html"/>
    <updated>2012-04-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://nateirwin.net/amen-to-this-on-readability-and-instapaper.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anil Dash in &lt;a href='http://dashes.com/anil/2012/04/readability-instapaper-the-network-and-the-price-we-pay.html'&gt;&amp;#8220;Readability, Instapaper, the Network, and the Price We Pay&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readability and Instapaper are two awesome reading tools that actually aren't in competition since Readability is mostly a network and Instapaper is mostly an app. But, foolish fanboy enthusiasm on both sides has got people choosing &quot;sides&quot; between the apps and turning legitimate feature debates into some sort of moral judgment of the people building the tools. Based on what I learned during a similar stage in the evolution of the blogging market, I fear these petty squabbles will hurt both tools and leave the market open only to the biggest, best-funded, most soulless competitors and that both these cool, innovative tools will lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to use Instapaper. It&amp;#8217;s a great little app. I now use Readability because of its minimalism, overall design, and integration with Reeder. This doesn&amp;#8217;t mean I&amp;#8217;m a bad person, and petty bickering and name-calling (I guess this is going on on both sides, but I&amp;#8217;ve only seen it coming from one group of bloggers) is not going to make me change my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel this same way about politics. If you&amp;#8217;ve got a point, by all means make it. But make it in a reasonable, measured, and intelligent way. If you start to tend towards sensationalism, I&amp;#8217;m going to ignore you and you&amp;#8217;re going to lose a lot of credibility in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
