title: Recent developments with NPMap
---

I wanted to post a quick status update on what the [NPMap team](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/team) has been working on:

First of all, our [newly-redesigned site](http://www.nps.gov/npmap) has a [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog) on it, so most (if not all) of my NPMap-related posts from this point will be going there. I'll still post occasional status updates here, but if you're interested in tracking progress on the [NPMap library](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/support/npmap-library.html) or keeping up with the projects we're working on, you'll want to subscribe to the blog's [feed](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog/atom.xml).







As I've mentioned before, I lead the NPMap team for the [U.S. National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov). Up until a few years ago, I was the only one working on our web mapping projects and the JavaScript library we maintain. In the last couple of years, however, our team has grown to three, and we are looking to add another developer in the coming months. We now have a bonafide team, including a data manager, a cartographer, and a developer (myself), and our workload and portfolio have grown with our capabilities.

With these changes, we decided that our old website -- which was really just an interim web presence to begin with -- was no longer cutting it, and decided to do a complete redesign and overhaul of the site. Our new website has been live for a few months now, and it includes a bunch of new content and a blog. You can view it at [http://www.nps.gov/npmap](http://www.nps.gov/npmap).

If you visit the site, you'll notice that Twitter buttons are prominent in several sections of the site. This is because we have decided to use Twitter as our primary communication mechanism. So if you are looking to keep up-to-date on NPMap developments, you'll want to [follow us](http://twitter.com/npmap). You may also want to [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/hdUeE) to our mailing list and [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog/atom.xml) if you're interested in following our work.
