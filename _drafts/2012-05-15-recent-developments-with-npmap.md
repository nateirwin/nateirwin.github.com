title: Recent developments with NPMap
---

As I've mentioned before, I lead the NPMap team for the [U.S. National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov). Up until a few years ago, I was the only one working on our web mapping projects and the JavaScript library we maintain. In the last couple of years, however, our team has grown to three, and we are expecting to add another developer in the coming months. We now have a bonafide team, including a data manager, a cartographer, and a developer (myself), and our workload and portfolio have grown along with our capabilities.

With these changes, we decided that our old website -- which was really just an interim web presence to begin with -- was no longer cutting it, and decided to do a complete overhaul. Our new website has been live for a few months now, and it includes a bunch of new content and a blog. You can view it at [http://www.nps.gov/npmap](http://www.nps.gov/npmap).

If you visit the site, you'll notice that Twitter buttons are prominent in several sections of the site. We have decided to use Twitter as our main communication mechanism. So if you are looking to keep up-to-date on NPMap developments, you'll want to [follow us](http://twitter.com/npmap). You may also want to [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/hdUeE) to our mailing list and [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog/atom.xml) if you're interested in following our work.
