title: Recent developments with NPMap
---

As I've mentioned before on this blog, the main project I work on for the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov) is a JavaScript library called NPMap. Up until a few years ago, I was the only one working on the library. Since then, our team has grown to three, and we are expecting to add another developer in the coming months. We now have a bonafide team, including a data manager, a cartographer, and a developer, and our workload and portfolio have grown with our capabilities.

With these changes, we decided that our old website -- which was really just an interim web presence to begin with -- was no longer cutting it, and decided to do a complete overhaul. I'm excited to announce that the website is live, and it now includes a bunch of new content and a blog. You can view it at [http://www.nps.gov/npmap](http://www.nps.gov/npmap).

If you visit the site, you'll notice that Twitter buttons are prominent in several of the site's sections. We have decided to use Twitter as our main communication mechanism. So if you are looking to keep up-to-date on NPMap developments, you'll want to [follow us](http://twitter.com/npmap). You may also want to [subscribe]() to our mailing list and [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog/atom.xml).






 and we're expecting to hire another developer in the next couple of months. We now have a bonafide team, including a data manager, a cartographer, and a developer.

With the larger team, we've been able to increase the support we provide the National Park Service, and we are now working on a large portfolio of projects.
