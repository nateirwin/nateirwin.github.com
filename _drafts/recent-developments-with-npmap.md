title: Recent developments with NPMap
---

I wanted to post a quick status update on what the [NPMap team](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/team) has been working on:









As I've mentioned before, I lead the NPMap team for the [U.S. National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov). Up until a few years ago, I worked alone on NPMap's web mapping projects and the NPMap library. This has changed in the last couple of years. The team has grown to three, and we are looking to add another developer in the next few months. We now have a bonafide team, including a data manager, a cartographer, and a developer, and our workload and portfolio have grown with our capabilities. We've made a lot of progress, and it seemed like a good idea to post an update on our progress here.

First of all, we recently released a [newly-redesigned site](http://www.nps.gov/npmap). The old website - which was really just an interim web presence to begin with - was no longer cutting it, so we decided to do a complete overhaul. The new site has been live for a couple of months now. It includes a slew of new content, a full gallery, updated support documentation, and, most importantly, a [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog). I'll be blogging regularly about the work our team is doing over there, so if you're interested in keeping up, you'll want to subscribe to the blog's [feed](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog/atom.xml).





 has a [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog) on it, so most (if not all) of my NPMap-related posts from this point will be going there. I'll still post occasional status updates here, but if you're interested in tracking progress on the [NPMap library](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/support/npmap-library.html) or keeping up with the projects we're working on, you'll want to subscribe to the blog's [feed](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog/atom.xml).




With these changes, we decided that our old website -- which was really just an interim web presence to begin with -- was no longer cutting it, and decided to do a complete redesign and overhaul of the site. Our new website has been live for a few months now, and it includes a bunch of new content and a blog. You can view it at [http://www.nps.gov/npmap](http://www.nps.gov/npmap).

If you visit the site, you'll notice that Twitter buttons are prominent in several sections of the site. This is because we have decided to use Twitter as our primary communication mechanism. So if you are looking to keep up-to-date on NPMap developments, you'll want to [follow us](http://twitter.com/npmap). You may also want to [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/hdUeE) to our mailing list and [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog/atom.xml) if you're interested in following our work.
