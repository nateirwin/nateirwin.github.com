title: Recent developments with NPMap
---

Given all of our recent progress on the NPMap front, I felt like it made sense to post a quick update here. Most of my posts about NPMap are going on our [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog), but I still plan on posting occasional tidbits about our work here.

A quick overview for those of you who don't know what NPMap is: NPMap is both a [team](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/team) that builds web maps for the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov) and a JavaScript <a href="http://www.nps.gov/npmap/support/library">library</a> that abstracts functionality and a NPS look-and-feel around open source and proprietary web mapping APIs. (If you're interested in finding out more, there's tons of information on [our website](http://www.nps.gov/npmap), and our slide deck, [Overview of NPMap](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/decks/overview-of-npmap/) is a great place to start.)

As I've mentioned before, I lead the NPMap team. Up until a few years ago, I worked alone on NPMap's web mapping projects and the library I built our projects on. This has (thankfully!) changed, and our team has grown to three and will soon be expanding to four. We are now what I would call a bonafide team, and combined we have the skill sets to take on any project, large or small. Our workload and portfolio have also grown with our capabilities. In short, we've made a lot of progress, and I'm proud of where we're at and where we're heading.

## News

First of all, we recently released a [completely redesigned website](http://www.nps.gov/npmap). The old site - which was really just an interim web presence to begin with - was no longer cutting it, so we decided to do a complete overhaul. The new site has been live for several months now. It includes a slew of new content, a full gallery, updated support documentation, and, perhaps most importantly, a [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog). Members of our team have already posted several great blog entries, so be sure to check it out. I'll also be using the blog to write about the work we're doing, so if you're interested in following us as we grow, you'll want to subscribe to the blog's [feed](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog/atom.xml).

Another exciting piece of news is our progress on the NPMap library itself. We just released the 0.8.0 version. This is a major release that took us over four months to get out. It includes a rebuilt and solidified API, a new simplified architecture, and a slew of new features, enhancements, and fixes. 


and we're going to use the rest of the work between there and the official 1.0 release to fix bugs and add additional functionality.

- The API has been solidified, and is ready for developers to use. It took us a while to hammer out the details, but it was important to us that we got things right. The way NPMap does things is different than traditional APIs. Everything's written in the modular code pattern, and NPMap makes some assumptions based on what the primary use case for the NPS is.







If you visit the site, you'll notice that Twitter buttons are prominent in several sections of the site. This is because we have decided to use Twitter as our primary communication mechanism. So if you are looking to keep up-to-date on NPMap developments, you'll want to [follow us](http://twitter.com/npmap). You may also want to [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/hdUeE) to our mailing list and [blog](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/blog/atom.xml) if you're interested in following our work.
